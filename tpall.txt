Checklist:
I never leave home without:
1. Sunglasses - I wear them all year around, and seem to need them more often, it's a habit
2. Music - cassettes, CDs
3. Palm Pilot - it's my lifeline. I think it's my P.A.'s computer, she rules my diary and I download it
4. Mobile phone
5. Amex card - they made such a fuss about giving it to me but I spend more time getting it turned down
